    <p>
        So, What about Yellow Dye ? How we obtain it, is there any easy way for this one ? <br />
        What can i say is that this dye isnt really much to use in Furnishing, <br />
        I've got plenty of its materials in my bag, well, except Cor lapis because i'm using it to ascend my Character,
        <br />
        It is plenty in my bag because only a few of furnishings that really need this dye and i think thats one only
        reason why i got plenty of it.

        Now, What materials do we need to make this Yellow Dye? <br />
        Only 2 of it, one i did mentioned it before <i>Cor Lapis</i>
        and two, Berry
    </p>
    <p>
        This all you can obtain it very easy by exploring map while you're mining or just strolling around chopping
        woods, but yes, once again i said it needs time spent to explore the map. <br />
        Some easy suggestion i would say, especially for Cor Lapis, You can bring <i>Qiqi</i> into your party <br />
        Since she will make good help with her passive <b>Former Life Memories</b> and display the location of resources
        unique to Liyue
        <!-- put qiqi passive pic here -->
    </p>
    <p>
        Or if you don't have Qiqi, you can use Ningguang since its easier to get her as 4* even tho
        she's not as handy as Qiqi passive. <br />
        but, her passive talent <b>Trove of Marvelous Treasures</b> will help you by Displaying the location of nearby
        ore veins
