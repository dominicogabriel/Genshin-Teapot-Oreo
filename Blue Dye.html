    <p>
        Blue dye, What i can say about this color is, i can well balance it by collecting it and making furniture out of
        it. <br />
        Still, my friend, it does need to explore the map to look for it's materials to make this blue dye. <br />
        It doesnt grow on trees, all of this dye materials are on ground, a <b>Mint leaf</b> or <b>Wolfhook</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For <i>Mint</i> it spread almost on all of Teyvat and i think it won't be a problem
        for you to find this one. <br />
        For <i>Wolfhook</i> i suggest looking it up, again, with Klee, since its a Resources unique to Mondstadt
        or you can look it up in Wolvendom where it spread all over the place and its an easy peasy if you have Klee on
        your party
