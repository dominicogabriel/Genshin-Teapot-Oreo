    <h1 class="Red Dye">The Red Dye's</h1>
    <p>
        So as we said before that we need materials to build our teapot (Housing),
        Dyes is one of materials we need and <i>Red</i> is one out of 3 Dyes we
        have so far in Genshin <br />
        this <i>Red dye</i> isnt really that hard and we have 3 materials that we
        need to collect to make this color. <br />
        Obtaining this Dye isnt really hard but you do need time to grind for the
        material either you gonna make it to Red dye right away or you wanna
        prepare it and use it later.
    </p>
    <!-- Red dye pic here --> <img src="Genshin Image/red dye.jpg" alt="Red dye" class="red dye">
    <p class="Material Dye">
        There's 3 types of material that you can use to making this dye
    <ul class="Material list">
        <li>Sunsettia</li>
        <li>Valberry</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To be honest, gaining this material isnt that hard to farm it but need time to grind and exploring the map.
        <br />
        For example, <i>Sunsettia</i>, it does grow on trees but not all trees are grow this fruit. Sometimes it's an
        Apple or most time it's nothing. <br />
        Thats why i really recommend you to look up at your map and explore while you farming those woods you looking
        for. It will come fast and handy while you do that
    </p>
    <p>
        As for <i>Valberry</i>, You can look it up easily if you have Klee, since it's her passive talent called <b>All
            of my treasures!</b>
        which gonna display the location of nearby <b>resources unique to Mondstadt</b> or Mondstadt specialities
        and <br /> <i>Carrot</i>, Well i could say it's pretty much easy to find if you go through some village like
        Springvale
        or other cause people there usually they farm this thing
        you just need to go around to find it!
