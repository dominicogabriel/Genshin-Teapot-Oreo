                    <p>
                        "Was i sleeping just now ?". I'm walking through a double-gate, A watch-tower standing high
                        looking through
                        out the horizon. <br />
                        I take my walk outside, a little lamp showing the way as i see a beautiful sea laid after me.
                        A blue water, A dark blue sky, Wind breeze towards me, as i walk through the land of Cool isle.

                    <p>
                        I'm arrived at some Garden, a fountain, surrounded by walls, there's a tree inside it
                        A wooden-bench near the fountain, i guess some people like to sit and spent time here. <br />
                        Two-lion statue, holding rock welcoming me as i take my walk towards the fountain.
                        I see an Orange light rock in front of the gate before entering the fountain. <br />
                        As i said to myself, this is a good place to spent a night

                    <p>
                        There's a shrine, standing high in a hill just near the strait. I asked people around
                        wonder if i can reach there and go up. <br />
                        I got my answer, i take my step towards the Shrine, A bamboo string covering the Shrine,
                        Two side-way lamp giving me a sight to the Shrine door, Another two lion statue just before it.
                        Need to take a climb to reach the Shrine, Arriving at the shrine wind blowing harder but a
                        beautiful
                        sea take more of my attention.

                        Two houses build just down near the hill, I heard someone calling me when i see downward.
                        An old man, i guess the one taking care this shrine, calling me. <br />
                        I took my way down, and talking to this old man just to find he wonder if i want a cup of Tea.
                        <br>
                        Accepting his offer, he told me to sit down as he making the tea. <br />
